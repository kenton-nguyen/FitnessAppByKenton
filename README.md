# Workout Like Kenton
A simple app that gives you a random workout chosen from a list of my personal favorite workouts throughout my fitness journey. Upon selecting the specific muscle group you wish to workout, the application will bring you to a page where you can press a button to generate a random workout for that muscle group each time you press the button. There is also a YouTube Android Player API included to view playlists that demonstrate how to do given exercises.

Note: App is not 100% complete as I might add in more features here and there where I see fit and the UI is trash.
