# Workout Like Kenton
A simple app that gives you a random workout chosen from a list of my personal favorite workouts throughout my fitness journey upon selecting the specific muscle group you wish to workout. There is also a YouTube Android Player API included to view playlists that demonstrate how to do given exercises.

Note: App is not 100% complete as I might add in more features here and there where I see fit.
